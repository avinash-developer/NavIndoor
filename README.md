Since indoor location and tracking systems overcome the shortcomings of 
conventional outdoor-based Global location System (GPS) technologies, they have 
brought in a new era of navigation and interaction within enclosed areas. While GPS 
has been very helpful in giving location information which rely on satellite signals 
and are primarily suited for outdoor environments, its signals frequently have trouble 
passing through structures, making placement indoors imprecise or inaccurate. Indoor 
positioning and tracking systems, which are especially made to function within the 
intricate and variable layouts of interior locations have been developed and improved 
because of this location accuracy gap.
